The Memo Clinic Log App. 
It allows the user to input the name, phone number and address of whoever they want to.

The app has a seperate field for the Therapy section which is being assigned to the patient i.e. Therapy Assigned which can be either Behavioral Therapy or Cognitive Therapy
The app also takes in the description on how the patient feels and the prescription i.e the place in which the patient is going to be assigned to by the doctor.
A menu is being added to the app which is the (detailed Log) and this displays the list of added patients i.e. their name and clinic they are assigned in a card layout.
Both the memo list and detailed list has  search bar added to them, in the memo list the search bar only searches up their name and the detailed log search bar searches up te therapy that have been assigned i.e Behavioral Therapy or Cognitive Therapy
The app has a full curd system and image added on to it.
